# close-to-home
#### a basic app that gets a user's closest interest match, from a list of users

This project uses handlebars for the backend js template,
but uses Vue for the front-end, to take advantage of the
reactive components of Vue, but not make it a single-page
app.




###History
I started the app with  ` express close-to-home --view hbs 
--css sass ` and adding VueJs as a js file, (mainly because 
i am jaded by the default express template engine). To tone 
down the Handlebars manliness, i added a bit of Sass as 
well. 

I decided to use MongoDB as the database layer, so that
would need to be pre-installed.

I also decided to use Typescript for the routes stuff, since
i am sort of used to it from my days with Angular. PHPStorm
has a file watcher thing that compiles the files on update,
so i did'nt actually have to do any changes on the Node.js 
stuff.
